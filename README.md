## Production Version Sprint Comments

### Patrick
Was easier to organize this sprint since we had done it for the web api.

### Linda Miao
### Challenges:
To test is a little challenge that conflict with existing file that I can not change by my role. But finally, that's all passing test by Bao's support. 

### Shiannel - Database, Deployment, & Admin API Endpoints
### Challenges: 
First time deploying to the cloud took some trial and error to get the database connection working. 
Working with Render and Supabase was new territory for me and was a struggle to get used to and 
figure out what was wrong.

#### What Went Well:
Already knew Swagger from last week, so the documentation was much faster this time
Team communicated well on Discord - no code conflicts when merging this week
Admin endpoints all worked after testing locally

## Beta II Sprint Comments

### Patrick

### Linda Miao - Database Setup & API Endpoint Development
**Challenges & Solutions**
- Data Population (95% complete): Attempted Python scripts initially, but SQL UPDATE queries in Supabase worked better (faster, avoided API caching issues). Team collaboration solved this.
- Database Relationships: First time recreating junction tables after Supabase reload. Learned how many-to-many relationships work.Team collaboration solved this.
- API Endpoint Development: First endpoint took longest to understand layer architecture (queries.ts → controller → routes). After pattern established, remaining 3 endpoints built faster.
- Data Type Issues: Year values returned as strings. Fixed by adding `.map()` conversion in controller layer.

**Key Learnings**
1. SQL more efficient than Python for bulk operations
2. Layered API architecture: Database → Controller → Routes
3. TypeScript compiles before testing (npx tsc)
4. Always test SQL queries in database first
5. Git branching keeps main branch safe

### Shiannel
- Swagger/OpenAPI specification completed, validated, and pushed to GitHub
- All endpoints documented, including CRUD operations, filter vocab, search features, and admin operations
- Data schemas defined for shows, cast, images, pagination, and error responses
- Health, images, and cast endpoints built and tested with Postman
- Documentation at `project_files/swagger.yaml`

### Shiraz
- Merging numerous branches can be painful, git is kind of finnicky with what it considers a conflict (sometimes even formatting counts)

### Bao

## Alpha Sprint Comments

**Database (Linda Miao):**
- Successfully designed and implemented. All tables created and populated with production data.
- Data Quality: 99.1% import success rate (7,316 of 7,382 shows). 66 records failed due to VARCHAR length constraints (can be fixed if needed).
- Performance: Database optimized with indexes on frequently queried columns. Average query time <100ms.

**Hosting Options (Bao Thinh Diep)**
- Tried several options for hosting web service.
- Some services are not sucessfull deployed.
- Render and Koyeb are the easiest deployments so far.

**API Documentation (Shiannel/Coco):**
- Swagger/OpenAPI specification completed and validated
- Documented 11 endpoints, including CRUD operations and search/filter features
- Added API key authentication requirements across all endpoints
- File pushed to GitHub at project_files/swagger.yaml and ready for implementation

**Project Plan (Shiraz)**
- The document in its current form describes the complete API.
- However, it the specifications only describe the essential functions that such an API should have.
- Additional functions may be added later, if time permits. Therefore, the document (and final product) is subject to change.

**Testing and review (Patrick Quaidoo)** 
- Made Dataset doc outlining the different datatypes in the .csv.
- Reviewed ER diagram and sql initialization script for accuracy.
- Reviewed and edited swagger yaml file to fit csv types.
